# Minsky Fellows Invocation

## Margaret Minsky

## Oct 3, 2017

Thank you to everyone involved in creating the Minsky Fellowships, and greetings to recipients Ben Bloomberg, Bjarke Felbo, and Kfir Schreiber.

My father also had a Fellowship at a crucial time in his career. It was the Harvard Junior Fellowship, and he was probably at a similar age as you. In fact, he was probably the exact average of your ages. It was a very special fellowship, and he said: “Membership in the Harvard Society of Fellows carries unique privileges; All doors to the university are opened; one is bound only by a simple oath to seek whatever seems the truth.”

It came at a important time for him because he was changing direction: from the neural-net models of the brain he had just worked on, in the form of a 300-page doctoral thesis and the construction of the world’s first neural-net machine, to grasping around for the new ideas which became symbolic AI.

It would be an interesting full circle of time if in your Minsky Fellowship years you end up grappling with both neural-net and other ideas, and how they will interact….but that’s not what I am going to talk about with you right now!!!

I’m going to talk about a lesson he taught: attach yourself to the right people; seek great minds to learn from and make them part of yourself.

Last week I was in Armenia, at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory up in the mountains. It was very emotional. I was standing in the same place as my father had in 1971 where he attended a conference on “Communication with Extraterrestrial Life.”

Marvin talked about this conference for the rest of his life. It was an exciting conference, and very unusual for Soviet times as it included a group of the best creative scientists from the USA, Soviet Armenia and Russia. It was fun, and they had ideas about …well…everything: How to communicate if there’s a different life form out there, how likely any life forms are to be out there, whether they would be biological or machines; if they are machines whether they would need 1016 bits and how small a colume could they cram that into. It was exciting for Marvin…because the conference collected smart, super smart friends and mentors. These were people such as Francis Crick famous for DNA biology, Carl Sagan, Freeman Dyson, Philip Morison, Iosef Schlovskii…

When Marvin said people are “smart”, he had a deeper view…“smart” people were the ones worth attaching to as role-models, mentors, and later he found a word for exactly what he meant by this: “imprimers”.

In 1993 he wrote:

> “Find a person whose thinking you like.  Attach yourself and make a copy in your head. So that you can think the same way, use the same resources, apply the same style.

"In my opinion that's absolutely the most important thing.  Even in my adult life, I've found that I deliberately do this.  In college I attached myself to a great young mathematician, Andrew Gleason, and to two great young psychologists, George Miller and Joe Licklider.  In graduate school I was attached to my fellow students John McCarthy and John Nash. Later I attached myself to Seymour Papert. And in later years, to my students Patrick Winston, Gerry Sussman, Tom Knight, and Danny Hillis.

"The trick is to hang around with your idols, try to anticipate how they'll solve each problem, or how they'll explain it.  After working at this long enough, you acquire a passable downloaded copy.

"Sometimes I can even get my downloaded ghosts of Warren McCulloch or Richard Feynman to explain things to me. My Feynman model is quite good at suggesting ways to think about some things, but it doesn't seem to know enough about quantum chromodynamics to explain that to me. I can't imagine what's wrong with it."

“What I'm suggesting”, he wrote, “is axiomatic to some people, but not understood at all by many others.”

When did this start for him?

He asked that question in his own writing.

He said, “I don't know. I didn’t do this consciously.  Until age 30 or so, when I became conscious of seeking and making these attachments.”

**Conscious** or not, he was **Conscientious** about these attachments:

His 6th grade science teacher at the Fieldston School, Herbert Zim, was one of his mentors. You may know Zim as the author of the Golden Guides, those compact little books on Rocks, the Seashore, Fossils, Plants, Animals…Zim even took him on a trip out West to collect fossils. Quite a field trip for a 6th grader. In 1993 Marvin wrote that he keeps in touch with Zim, calls him every few years, talks to him about what he’s up to, he now lives in Florida…

When he was 20 years old, he did a bachelor’s thesis on fixed-point theorems.  Shizuo Kakutani started that field. In 1993 Marvin wrote
“I called Kakutani recently…around 1990…to thank him. Perhaps I was reminded by the Japan Prize, and Kakutani started his career in Japan. That’s 40 years after my Bachelor’s Thesis.” Again, it’s the person.

A couple of years later as a  young mathematician, he  wrote, “I had an adventure, more thrilling than any social or physical adventure. That adventure was an old book. It is Dimension Theory by Hurevicz and Wallman.   And it’s out of print. He said, “This book was my introduction to the idea that, in order to understand anything well, you need to have multiple ways to represent it. Because it has such different ways of understanding the meaning of the concept of ‘dimension’”. “Years later”, he goes on “this was my inspiration for writing my own book about the different ways of understanding computation, in _Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines_.”

But here’s the punchline again: the conscientious attachment to the person, the mentor, the role-model, the imprimer: “When I finished the book,” he said, “I sought out Witold Hurevicz, and made a new friend—from whom to learn more new ways to think.”

And so to help you continue your **conscious** journey with role-models, with mentors, and imprimers, Marvin chose for you, and I’ve chosen it from him, this line from Aristotle, in Rhetoric 2,6:

“Such persons are: those who admire us, those whom we admire, those by whom we wish to be admired, those with whom we are competing, and whose opinion of us we respect.”

To help myself with this **conscious** journey, I chose this line written by my father in 1993:
“One needs at least one parent that is worth copying”

Fellows, the mentors of yours and mine who are here tonight have made a very **conscious** and **conscientious** choice to bring you into the family of Minsky Fellows, and our family of imprimers. And we look so much forward to learning how you think.

On this night, the Minsky Fellows were presented with gifts of hardback copies of Society of Mind from libraries all over the world.
