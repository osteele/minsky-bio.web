[This is from Backup of TOPICS!!!]

I’m a scientist, and I really like being one.  So I'm going to tell you some stories about why I like it so much.  The idea of this book formed one night when Gloria and I were having dinner with the Emperor and Empress of Japan and I found myself telling them some of these stories.  The Emperor was something of a scientist, too, but he explained that most of his time is occupied with his duties as head of state; most days are filled with brief symbolic appointments and there’s not much time left for his scientific specialty in marine biology.  But there was time that evening to talk about the migrations of eels, and you could see the excitement and gleam in his eye when we finally got down to details.   I’m sure most people know that virtually all the different varieties of eels in the Atlantic come to the same place to find mates -- in the Sargasso sea formation near the Canary Islands.  Toi do this though, they have to migrate for thousands of miles, just as do the Salmon in the Pacific Northeast migrate back to the Columbia River and then upstream to their particular birthplaces, when it come time for them to spawn.
But how do those eels know where to go—and how did this curious instinct evolve.   It is not so hard to make theories of this for those Atlantic Eels.  After all, that ocean itself is not very old, less than a hundred million years—and the ancestors of those species of eels is much older than that.  So perhaps it all started in some landlocked lake where those eels had established a mating place.  Then formed a rift, as a continental plate was torn apart by deep subterranean forces, and the rift widened, by only an inch or so, per year, until it spanned 3ooo miles.

As we were talking about this, I thought about the circumstance of discussing this subject in Japan, a country that is especially concerned with the drift of continents and the earthquakes that are now known to be caused by those motions.  Where, if anywhere, do the Pacific eels meet?

(Next: last night (at the AAACH, May 23, 1998) I was discussing something else with Ian Munson, the Scottish embryologist who led the group that did the “Daisy” cloning experiment.   I was explaining an idea about connecting small wires to some of the nerve cells in human brains, so that we could get better interfaces between our computers and our minds.  I complained that we did not have good enough ways to connect to those nerves without causing damage.  Munson suggested that we should, instead, evolve new kinds of nerve cells that would themselves make the connections we wanted, and then carry that information between the brain and the skin, where it would be easier to make less harmful connections.  (Or to small implanted computer devices.)  I had not myself though so boldly about exploiting more basic biology.  I didn’t think of trying to do this myself—but now this idea is fixed in my mind, and when I have the opportunity, I’ll try to pass it along to someone who might be able to modify the genetics of cultures of nerves.

That’s what I do—form ideas, push them on other people, and find other people to push them on me.  To do this, you have to know a pretty wide assorment to``of things, and the people that I’m attracted to are largely other with that kind of trait.

While discussing this with the Emperor, part of my mind turned back to the spring of 1945, when I was finishing boot camp in the United States Navy, and looking forward to being shipped out, perhaps to die on some Pacific Island in that war against that Emperor’s armies.  However, on [date] and [date] the atomic bobm was deplyed against two Japanese cities and the war ended in a matter of A FEW DAYS.  Naturally, when I hear others discussing the ethical morality of that action, I find it hard to be impartial, or dispassionate about this.  I did not discuss this with the Emperor, however, and this was not so much because I felt it wouold be inappropriate, but because the topic of eels seemed so much more interesting.  In [xxx] I’ll return to my dislkike of discussions of ethics, but in short, I’ve found that usualy they simply do not make any sense.  They only reflect in complex ways, the shortsighted opinions of reltively nonreflective people.  [I should add that, like anyone else, I’m often forced to make deciions about which alternitive is more ‘good’ or more ‘right’—but I don’t like to pretend to deduce this from unexamined assumptions.  Instead, I simply compare the consequences of the alternatives, and decide which of them feels more comfortable.  If that doen’t work, I usually ask one of my children, who are always easuly accessible through email, and all of whom seem much better at this than I am.

<And because there were also three seismic scientists at the same Japan Prize dinner, from France, England, and the US.  Describe the social world of International Science.>

Well, I have a lot of stories to tell.  The trouble is, I'm not sure about all the details.   I'm not sure all these things actually happened the way I remember them.  A lot of the details are either just made up, or are mixed up with parts of other experiences, or were just filled in by common sense reasoning.    Memory is tricky.  Besides, I lied.  I'm not really a scientist, at least I'm not really sure about that.  Because wouldn’t any true scientist have maintained precise diaries and notebooks for recording everything that happened?  Well, I simply don't have any, and never did.  Except for a few times when I started one, but wasn't orderly enough to keep it up to date.  I don't even own a white coat, so I can't be much of a scientist, anyway.	<My self image.  Not a scientist.  Just a confused person.  Disorderly and unsystematic.  When I lecture, I ramble from one thing to another.  Some listeners complain that there's no plot and no structure.  Other listeners come and tell me about how cleverly the threads are woven with one another, and how in the end each part supports the rest, and how all the loose ends finally come together>  So sometimes I regard myself as a faker, a con artist, and doing a good job of it.  Fooling thousands of people into thinking that I'm a scientist.  I must have fooled enough of them to have become president of a big scientific society -- the American Association for Artificial Intelligence -- and member of three National Academies, and to have won the international Japan Prize for Science and Technology in 1990.   And I'll try to explain how some of that happened -- but really, I'm not at all sure.  If I had those notebooks it might help -- but then, I suppose, I wouldn't have been me.  And anyway, it's probably a good thing that they don't exist.  Or Senator Dingell might subpoena them and then I'd be in trouble.

(Yes, memory is tricky.  When you don't know, you guess -- but you don't know how you do this, where those guesses come from.  Or how the memories work in the first place.  In fact, that's my technical specialty -- making new theories about how memories work, and getting people to do experiments to see if those theories could be right.)

## Minsky memory

This book is a sort of autobiography, a collection of stories and anecdotes from my memory.  They are things that seem to have happened to me  So the word "I" appears again and again, and that makes me uncomfortable.

* It seems self-centered.  What if the function of egotism?  It has something to do with memes?
* It opposes my own view of things.  What is an individual?
* The "me" is a society, a synthesis, a variable.
* Egotism appears to demand "credit".  But the formation of the SoM is part of the large system, my culture, acquaintances, and their history.  I could say that "everything in the world is connected, and each of us is merely a node in that vast web of interactions.  But I don't want to embrace a mystic unity.  No, the problem is where to focus, between 1,2,3 and Infinity!

* And the memories are not reliable.  I don't believe there is much a=of a tape-recorder in the mind.  My friend Schank says that memories are composed stories.  Drafted and edited.

I can't remember much of high school.   It is almost as though  I first became conscious around 1957, at the age of thirty.  It is hard to remember much of what happened before that.  Perhaps it is because my model of people changed, from social to psychological.   Now I could sort of see inside them.  I would now see cause, instead of fault; mechanism rather than motive.
