Title:  The AI Adventure

I will attempt an informal description of my experience of being a
"pioneer" in AI research.  It was -- and still is -- an excellent
adventure, for several different reasons.

First, I enjoyed the company of an earlier generation of fearless
adventurers.  In the scientific sphere, these included McCulloch,
Pitts, Selfridge, Shannon, von Neumann, Wiener, Ashby, Grey Walter,
and the like.  But I was also encouraged by the likes of Isaac Asimov
and John W. Campbell.  And then, as the Cybernetic era closed, I
enjoyed the fabulous company of the next wave -- the McCarthys,
Newells, Simons, Solomonoffs, and most of those you see on the new
AAAI fellows register.

obit: 	I first encountered Asimov's thought  some 50 years ago. I was just beginning my teens and he was only in his early 20-- yet  he seemed centuries ahead.  I was entranced by his stories about space and time, but his ideas about robots  affected me most.  Surely, some day, we'd build robots that think --but how well would they think about what?  Would  logic work?  Surely yes, for some things, but not for some others. And what about commonsense, intuition, consciousness, emotion, and all the other mysteries of mind; how to build robots with those?  How, for that matter, do our brains do those things?  And after Isaac's story "Runaround" appeared in the March 1942 issue of Astounding, I never stopped thinking about how minds might work.  (In the same way, Robert A. Heinlein's 1940 novel "Waldo" had already turned me to thinking about the mechanical aspects of robotics.)  And for me these writers arrived just in time, for I had just exhausted the teachings of Jules Verne and H.G.Wells.   Why do I say "teaching"?  Because these thinkers instruct us in courageous ways to explore new ideas, to exercise the capacity to ask "what if" --  a vital function that tends to decline as most of us grow more competent and sensible.  As another such writer, Larry Niven, once explained, "our job is to keep on daydreaming for you."  And I was particularly  privileged to share the friendship of these great teachers, as well as of others -- including Arthur C. Clarke, Frederik Pohl, and Ted Sturgeon -- and even their great editor-writer John Campbell.

Here's another one: I corrected some spelling.

> Shortly after the Dean “anti-gravity” drive was described in Astounding, John Campbell published a picture of it. I examined the picture with a lens and managed to read the brand name of the bathroom scale used to measure the loss of weight of the machine. My college roommate, Roland Silver, and I conjectured correctly that this scale had a "diode" in it that coupled the platform and the reading device. So we went to Sears Roebuck in Porter Square, Cambridge and bought that very scale.

> When you stand on it it reads your weight fine, but if you pump your arms up and down -- just as did the Dean machine itself -- then the weight fluctuates a lot -- with the mean weight (and even the maximum) far below the real weight.
>
> So then Claude Shannon and John Pierce and I wrote a sharp detailed letter to Campbell about this.
>
> John Campbell didn't print our letter, but he sent me a long letter that I still have here, denouncing establishment scientists for their reactionary and unimaginative rigidity and general intolerance.
>
> Suitably chastened, I dropped the matter and continued with my reactionary, establishment-bound studies.
>
> Anyway, this incident jibes with Pournelle's account about Campbell seeing the machine which "jumped around a lot" on a bathroom scale. I checked out all the other scales, too, and finally found one that reads high when you bounce. But these were much less common. So, possibly, Dean was hoist by this pitiful petard. But I maintained that this was extremely unlikely since, obviously, he was all too familiar with flaky, vibrating, weighing mechanisms.

(And I might have got the idea from an old John Campbell story in which people were making materials at the intersections of mysteriously high-tech beams.)

> The trouble is that they *still* havent' explored this, and they all believe that "people can't manipulate things with a time-delay in the loop". This is wrong, because the problems go away as the times become longer.  (I think they peak at 1/2 second, but I have no good evidence, except that people can easily learn to dock boats, etc.
